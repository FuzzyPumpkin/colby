Colby Critiques
current version: 1.0

This is a small, very specialized review/blog site created with Node.js, MongoDB, and various packages, using Bootstrap 4.0 as a CSS framework. Site features user authentication and permissions relating to editing/creating/delete routes. Bootstrap 4.0 was used to show familiarity with the framework and styles were kept mostly to those available with the framework. I tried to keep manual CSS to a minimum since manual CSS is my preference, as a challenge.

Languages/Frameworks/Databases used:
* HTML/CSS/Javascript, the trinity
* Node.js
* Bootstrap 4.0
* MongoDB

Node.js packages used:
* body-parser
* connect-flash
* ejs
* express
* express-session
* method-override
* moment
* mongoose
* passport

Future plans: 
* Design overhaul. Right now the site look is very basic. Contemplating adding some subtle animations.
* Splash/landing page. Would like a small intro to Colby and his world, plus site premise expanded upon.

As an added bonus, there is an easter egg you can find on the site. You must be logged in. Happy clicking!
